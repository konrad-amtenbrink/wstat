# wstat

wstat is a **dead simple** script that basically tells you if the temperature was below freezing in the last 7 days.

> :warning: **Disclaimer**: This was just a simple poc to test backend development in rust.

(wstat only checks the weather of Berlin, Germany)

To try it out just click [here](https://weather.konrad-amtenbrink.com/status)
